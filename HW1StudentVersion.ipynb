        "\n",
        "There will be times when you have similar (but not exact) data between columns that you would like to join on. Convential joins, like the one you did above, will scan through each of the specified join columns, and find **exact** matches to establish that the rows from the associated datasets can be combined together into one row. But what happens if the join operation sees \"Mr.Smith\" in one dataset versus \"Mr Smith\"? It will skip over and think these two entries can't be joined even though there is a minor difference and the two values should be matched. This is where we combine n-grams with Jaccard Simalirty.\n",
        "\n",
        "This sounds scary but I'll break it down. An n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items. An example would be given the sentence: \"Craig has a 2.2 GPA\" ... If we were looking at an n-gram of two, the results would be: [\"Craig has\", \"has a\", \"a 2.2\", \"2.2 GPA\"] (I swear my GPA isn't that. It's lower.)\n",
        "\n",
        "The above example is tokenizing/breaking up the n-grams by spaces. However, we can also do it characterwise. Given \"Craig has a 2.2 GPA\" with n-gram of 2 and doing characterwise splits, we will have: [\"Cr\", \"ra\", \"ai\", \"ig\", \" h\", \"ha\" ...]\n",

If you take a look, these two columns share the same type of information but are formatted differently (i.e. \"UPPER WEST SIDE (59-79)\" in zillow_df versus \"Upper West Side\" in airbnb_df. We know these columns mean very similar things but merge/join operations don't. A possibility is to clean that column so that the formats match. But what if you have a ton of entries and you can't possibly account for everything?\n",
